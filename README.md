##### (php lodash)

*This is not fully production ready*

A simple PHP implementation of the awesome [lodash](https://https://lodash.com/docs)
javascript library.

A large portion is thin wrappers around native PHP functions. Where ever the native
function may have mutated the original value, a different implementation is used.

### Installation
Down load the zip archive and install it in your path

### Current features
- Single class
- No mutations,
- **PURE** functions (well, methods)
- Access via object (->) or class (::)

The links below will take you do the documentation for each subset of functions.
Examples are with each definition

#### [Arrays](/docs/arrays.md)
#### [Tests](/docs/tests.md)

## @Todo
- Finish porting everything over
